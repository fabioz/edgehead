ROOM: $tunnel_cancel_chance


DESCRIPTION:
After a few strides, you realize Briana is still standing in the circular room behind you.


_"Are you not coming?"_


Briana hesitates. "It feels like we could have done more." She motions toward the goblin, then extends her gesture to the rest of the mountain. "Wreak more havoc. I mean, we might be the first slaves in Mount Bloodrock to survive." 


EXITS:
$tunnel (Continue): You shake your head and continue through the passage. Soon, you find yourself climbing a steep, poorly lit stairway. Briana catches up with you quickly.
$guardpost_above_church (Return): You nod and step back into the circular room.
