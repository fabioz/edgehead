ROOM: $exit_from_bloodrock


FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
Only a few bends ahead, the tunnel gets blindingly bright and you catch the scent of fresh mountain air. The surface! For the first time in three years, you hear the howling wind.


You run through a small stone doorway and out of the mountain.


The blinding sun makes you squint. You let the wind chill your muscles and then you jump down a steep descending path.


Outside, you and Briana have the upper hand. The orcs and goblins are used to the dark, dank caves, and they come out only when they must.


Soon, the orcs and goblins stop following altogether, presumably leaving the two of you to their aboveground brothers.


You look around for a safe route. At first, you cannot make much sense of what you see — this is nothing like the country you left three years ago. Black smoke rises from orc camps and razed villages. You look out over the burned forests and notice the cracks in the wall of the distant Fort Ironcast, just visible over the Glenview Hill. You see no birds, only some horrible dark eagle-like creatures that have no heads circling in both directions above Mount Bloodrock.

Briana doesn't seem surprised.


_"We have to stop this."_

Briana follows your gaze, then shakes her head. "This is bigger than us, Aren. This is a problem for kings, not peasants."

_"No king has what we have."_

- THEN:
"Orcthorn? Bah, you think they'll let you keep it? A farmhand?"

_"I am_ not _a farmhand. And I do not mean Orcthorn, no. I have a strange connection. We both do."_

- THEN:
"Let me guess. Muscles and a bit of brains? Don't be a fool, you're still a farmhand."

_"I am_ not _a farmhand. And I don't mean muscles or brains, no. I have a strange connection. We both do."_
- END RULE
- END RULESET


"A connection."


_"With the Dead Prince. I dream his dreams. I think I have some of his power. You feel it, too — I am sure of it — but you have not been in the mountain for as long as I have. Most slaves are lucky to survive the first month. I survived three years."_


"So the thing you have that kings don't is… a way to communicate? Or negotiate with him?"


_"Negotiate? No, I do not have anything the Dead Prince wants. I do not think any mortal man does. But I think I am starting to understand what that is, and how the Dead Prince wants to seize it."_


"So what’s the plan?"


_"Giving him the exact opposite of what he wants."_


"You know we could just run, slay some orcs along the way, and get as far away from this place as possible, right?"


_"Yes."_


"Anyone else would do exactly that."


_"But we will not."_


Briana sighs. "No, I suppose we won't."


With that, you both start down the road toward the black fort in the distance.


THE END.
