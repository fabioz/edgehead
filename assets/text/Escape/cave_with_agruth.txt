ROOM: $cave_with_agruth


FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
The tunnel back to the main slave quarters is likely suicide. There will be too many orcs, and the Gate of Screams is a long way beyond, at the very base of Mount Bloodrock. 


That leaves two options: the black passage toward the war forges and the deserted tunnel to the Unholy Church, an underground temple. Both these paths eventually lead to the Upper Door, which will bring you out of the caves close to Mount Bloodrock's mountaintop.


DESCRIPTION:
The corpse lies still, getting cold.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
You search his pockets but turn up with nothing. Just then, you realize that if Agruth had something valuable on him, he would have hidden it well. You run your hand inside his vest and find a _troma_ herb. This boosts your energy right when you need it – very handy.
