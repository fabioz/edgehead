COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
_"Do you not want to kill some more orcs?"_


"I do, trust me. I just don't want to get killed first."


You shake your head and start walking. Briana reluctantly follows, her eyes darting around the familiar tunnel. You're close to where the orcs had kept you during sleeping hours.


Soon, you see an orc patrol appear from behind a bend. Here, it's impossible to hide. The orcs spot you immediatelly. 


There are three of them, one has a longsword, the second has a spear, and the third holds a large battle axe.


The orc with the spear hurls it, and it pierces Briana's shoulder. She screams in pain. 


The orc with the sword makes three fast leaps toward you, and swings his weapon. You have no time to react, and the blade slits your throat. You gurgle and your arms flail in surprise.


You look at Briana. As the battle axe cleaves her stomach, the two of you hold eye contact.
