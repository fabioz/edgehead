ROOM: $war_forge


FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
You enter the enormous cave that houses Mount Bloodrock's war forges. This space is so vast that it has its own climate, with dark clouds covering most of the ceiling, and what looks like black rain falling in the distance. Large crooked  bats circle just below the clouds, their shrieks mixing with the clangs of steel and constant angry shouts from below.


- RULESET
- RULE:
  justCameFrom(w, "cave_with_agruth")
- THEN:
You and Briana duck behind two carts on a walkway that leads up above the cave’s floor. You can see a flight of stairs ahead that hugs one side of the cave, and follows a large stone wall. This must be the way through the smelter, and towards the Upper Door. Thankfully, there’s no one in the way.

- END RULE
- RULE:
  justCameFrom(w, "smelter")
- THEN:
You and Briana stand on a walkway high above the cave’s floor. You can see a flight of stairs ahead that hugs one side of the cave, and leads toward the bottom. Down there, you recognize a passage in the rock that you know must descend deeper into the mountain, toward the slave quarters, and where you slayed Agruth. There’s no one in the way.

DESCRIPTION:
// TODO: change after the iron monster was destroyed
// TODO: pure chaos if player has done the throw in smelter.

The air in the war forge is thick and makes breathing difficult, and the constant noise is overwhelming.

EXITS:
$smelter (Go to smelter): You keep low, ascending the stairs. When you reach the top, you feel a wave of hot air coming from a passage in the wall. You make your way through it.


$cave_with_agruth (Go back to the cave with Agruth's corpse): You sneak back toward where you left Agruth's body.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The cave is natural, but on the side of the smelter you see an artificial wall, like a stone dam. From an opening high on that wall, suspended troughs of molten steel descend into every section of the room like huge fiery tentacles. 


At the end of each of the troughs, teams of orcs pour the steel into molds for axes, war hammers, and greatswords. The clamor of hammers hitting anvils is deafening, and the strong smell of iron and soot mixes with the stench of all that orc sweat.


This place makes Fort Ironcast's military forge look like a doll house: tiny and inconsequential.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
You look out from your hiding spot and scan the room. More likely than not, no human has ever seen this place and lived to tell the tale.


Briana shakes her head: "The orcs are working together with ogres." A smirk forms on her lips. "They must be terrified."


You scan the workers more closely. The slow-moving ogres tower over the orcs. 


_"And they don't use slaves here. They must be doing something important."_


Looking again at the molds they are using, you don't see anything strange or unexpected. Primitive axes and swords, some armor.


"What is that thing!" Briana gasps. 


You follow her stare and at first all you see is just a cluster of slightly larger forges. Then you squint and an image appears. It’s an enormous, repulsive, half-assembled insect. Each leg reaches as far as you could throw a rock. And there are eight of them. Then there's the body — a huge cockroach-like contraption forged from steel. The teeth are already completed, sharp and menacing, and as long as a man is tall. 


A full-sized ogre pours water over one section of the creature, making a thick cloud of steam. You can't see much else. From the high opening in the smelter wall, molten steel is starting to flow down to fill another part of the iron monster.


// I don't know what it is but I would not want to meet it in battle. - it is probably meant to scale castle walls. - so, fort ironcast.
