ROOM: $tunnel


FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
Almost as soon as the circular room disappears from your line of sight, loud shouting rises from deep within the mountain. You hurry up, taking the high stairs by two. The voices from below quiet down a bit, and now you can hear dozens of orc and goblin feet stomping.


The air gets colder and fresher, but there's still no end in sight. The stairs get steeper and steeper until you feel like you’re climbing a ladder.


"I have…" Briana gasps, catching her breath. "I have not fought my way through the depths of Mount Bloodrock just to die of exhaustion on its doorstep."


_"That… that would be disappointing, yes."_


The sounds from behind grow louder. You can now pick out individual voices, although not what they are saying.


The stairway suddenly makes a sharp left turn and levels out. Tasting blood on the roof of your mouth, your whole body demands that you stop — but you start running anyway. Briana follows close behind.


The light in the tunnel gets brighter and the air gets colder. Suddenly, just when you can smell fresh air, an orc and a goblin jump out in front of you from a slimy crevice, swords in hands.

They must be guarding the Upper Door. There is no way around them.
