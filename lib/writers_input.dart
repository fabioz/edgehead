It doesn\'t take long before you start hearing voices. Orcs and goblins shouting commands, mostly. Then human screams.


The tunnel gets wider and better lit by torches. The walls are smoother. You stop down next to a small, reinforced door. Up ahead, something is happening. A human slave is running towards you. His hand is visibly broken just above the elbow and blood is streaming down his limping left leg. His lips are moving but there is no sound anymore, only pain. Eyes in tears, he doesn\'t see you or anything else.


Before you can so much as call to him, something long and sharp shoots from behind the slave, and into his back. A bloodied spearhead appears in the center of the man\'s chest, as if growing from there. The tearful eyes go down, looking at the fatal wound. Two more steps and the slave falls face down, the shaft of the spear protruding upwards from his back.


An orc and a goblin appear from the tunnel, walking towards the dead man. The orc is laughing, patting his companion on the back. "Vicious throw, small one!" he roars.


You step back and motion Briana to lean on the wall, hoping that the door\'s embossed frame will provide enough cover before the two slavers turn again. 


But at that time, something or someone smashes on that very door from the inside. Then come angry growls and something akin to barking and howling.


The door stays shut but the two slavers are now looking directly at you. The goblin yanks his spear from the corpse, and the orc unsheathes his sword. They start towards you.

        '''You move to a shadow and wait. After a few heartbeats, there is a scraping sound of stone against stone. You lean out from your hiding and see a part of the wall to the right of the altar opening.


An orc priest, tall and pale, enters from the stone door. At that time, the whole temple reverberates with a strong, dissonant tone that is somehow both sickening and appealing at the same time. It\'s like a groan of some large beast awakening.


After the priest, a huge creature enters through the door, crouching below the frame. It\'s unclear what it is, but possibly some large breed of ogre, and judging by the braided hair, a female. Her sword â€” attached to her hip with a rope â€” is as long as you are tall. 


When she enters the temple and unbends, you can see that she leads someone on a chain. An orc. Despite being a strong one, probably a captain or even a chieftain, he is dwarfed by the creature before him, and he visibly shakes in horror.


The three of them â€” the priest, the ogre and the orc â€” go around the altar and stop before it, facing the symbol of the octopus, and away from you and Briana. The dissonant tone stops. You lean a little further out from your hiding, to have a better view.


Without words, the priest beckons the orc to lie at the altar. The orc is now shaking uncontrollably, but complies. You can hear his fitful breath, the rustle of his body against the stone as he glides into position, and nothing else.


When the orc lies on the altar, the female ogre walks up to him and places her hands on his shoulders, pinning him down.


_"Maggots."_


Somehow, you know. Briana gives you a puzzled look, then turns back to the altar. From the shadows in the base of the altar, a swarm of large black insects starts to make its way to the top, towards the terrified orc. The priest lifts his arms as if in silent worship.


The ogre pushes down, preparing for the inevitable struggle. The orc senses it, tenses up and opens his mouth to scream.


But the scream doesn\'t come. Instead of it, the dissonant tone sounds again, more powerful than before.


The maggots crawl over the edge of the altar\'s top, onto the orc\'s body, heading straight towards his face. They move faster now.




The orc\'s eyes go wide. He struggles against the ogre\'s grip, pointlessly. The dissonant tone gets even louder. The temple quivers. The sound permeates everything.


This has a strange effect on you. Suddenly, the terror of the moment is fully replaced by something of an opposite â€” an invigorating feeling of power. You breathe in and feel stronger, refreshed. (Your stamina increases by +1.)


You notice that the priest takes a deep breath as well.


Then, suddenly, the sound stops, and the orc\'s body sinks. The invigorating feeling is gone. You realize the maggots have eaten through the orc\'s eyes and cheeks, and that they are now scuttling back to the base of the altar.


The priest puts his arms down again, and â€” without ceremony â€” heads back to the stone door. The ogre takes the orc\'s dead body, puts it over her shoulder, and follows. In a few heartbeats, they are all gone and the door is closed. A new splash of blood on the altar is the only reminder of the scene.


Briana doesn\'t look at you. "How did you know it will be maggots?"


_"I do not know."_


"Is thisâ€¦ I _felt_ that sound, somehow. I _felt_ it."


_"This place does something weird to people."_


"And if that orc was meant to be an offering, why did they not leave the body?" Briana shakes her head, still not looking at you. "Let\'sâ€¦ let\'s just get out of here."

You scan the workers, noticing the slow-moving ogres that tower over the orcs. "And they don\'t use slaves here," you say. "There must be something important going on here." Looking again at the molds they are using, you don\'t see anything out of the expected. Primitive axes and swords, some armor.


"What is that thing!" Briana gasps. You follow her stare and at first all you see is just a cluster of slightly larger forges. Then you squint and an image appears. An image of an enormous, repulsive, half-assembled insect. Each leg, or whatever they are, is as long as a good rock\'s throw. There are eight of them. Then there\'s the body â€” a huge cockroach-like contraption. The teeth of steel are already completed, sharp and menacing and as long as a man. 


A full-sized ogre is pouring water over one part of the form just now, producing a cloud of steam. You can\'t see much else. From the high opening in the smelter wall, molten steel is starting to flow down to fill another part of the iron monster.
