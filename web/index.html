        Escape slavery in Mount Bloodrock, an underground enclave of orcs and goblins preparing for war. What will you discover in these dark caves? What mayhem can you wreak on your way out? And how will you former captors remember you?

      <h2>About the story</h2>

      <p>
        In the end, it does not really matter how a person becomes a slave. Some people will shiver below a table when an orc's hand grabs them and another binds them with rope. Others squirm in a bag as they're being hauled on a war horse. Yet others fall into primitive traps in the woods.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not you. You became a slave by attacking an orc war camp, all by yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        It felt good at first. You screamed at the top of your lungs, axe raised over your head. It was your revenge. It was suicide, but it had meaning. It was beautiful.
      </p>

      <p>
        It turned ugly fast. The first orc swatted your axe away easily, kicked you to the ground, and knocked you out cold.
      </p>

      <p>
        The orcs took you back to their caves in Mount Bloodrock, a dark peak of the Aelphremede mountain range. It is visible from as far as the rich markets of Azerley or the giant corpses of Highwynd, and surrounded by the human kingdom of Grayshore — yet it has never been fully explored. You quickly learned this enclave is a kingdom of its own, with miles of tunnels, war forges, barracks, altars, and hundreds of slaves. You also learned the orcs and the goblins are not acting independently, and that the mountain has an evil of its own.
      </p>

      <p>Your dream of a heroic deed and death became a nightmare of slavery. </p>

        <h3>What's the big idea?</h3>

        <p>
          This egamebook aims to provide the freedom
          that one would expect from an open-world RPG game &mdash; simulated environment,
          autonomous AI agents, resources, places to explore &mdash; but instead
          of rendering all that in 2D or 3D graphics, render it in writing.
          Think Skyrim, in prose.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can learn more about the ideas behind this at
          <a href="http://egamebook.com/">egamebook.com</a>.
          This project is part of the author's evil masterplan to create
          enjoyable long texts for the coming generation. Society is better off
          when its people are able and willing to read substantial
          written work.
        </p>
