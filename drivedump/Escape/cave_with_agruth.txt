ROOM: $cave_with_agruth




DESCRIPTION:
The tunnel back to the main slave quarters is suicide. There will be too many orcs, and the Gate of Screams is a long way beyond, at the very base of Mount Bloodrock. That leaves two options: the black passage towards the war forges, and the deserted tunnel to the Unholy Church, an underground temple. Both these paths lead upwards and in the general direction of a small exit near the mountaintop — the Upper Door.




SHORT_DESCRIPTION:
The corpse lies still, getting cold.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
You search his pockets but turn up with nothing. Just then, you realize that if Agruth had something valuable on him, he would have hidden it well. You run your hand inside his vest and find a troma herb. This boosts your energy right when you need it--very handy. (Your stamina increases by 1.)
