ROOM: $cave_with_agruth




DESCRIPTION:
The tunnel back to the main slave quarters is suicide. There will be too many orcs, and the Gate of Screams is a long way beyond. That leaves two options. The black passage towards the war forges, and the deserted tunnel to the Unholy Church, an underground temple. Both paths should lead you towards the Upper Door, a small entrance at the side of Mount Bloodrock.




SHORT_DESCRIPTION:
The corpse lies still, getting cold.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
You search his pockets but turn up with nothing. Just then, you realize that if Agruth had something valuable on him, he would have hidden it well. You run your hand inside his vest and find a troma herb. This boosts your energy right when you need it--very handy. (Your stamina increases by 1.)
