ROOM: $guardpost_above_church


DESCRIPTION:
You enter a small, circular room. There are exits on three sides, all marked with where they lead to.


[[CODE]]
if (justCameFrom(w, "smelter")) { 
  s.add("""The passage you came from is marked with the words "Hot iron", which must mean "smelter" in the orcs' vocabulary. Another one has the words "Unholy Church" above it. Both of these slope downwards.""");
}

[[CODE]]
if (justCameFrom(w, "underground_church")) { 
  s.add("""The passage you came from is marked with the words "Unholy Church". Another one has the words "Hot iron" above it, which must mean "smelter" in the orcs' vocabulary. Both of these slope downwards.""");
}
[[/CODE]]


A third passage is marked "Up Door", and a few paces beyond the opening, it turns into a steep stairway upwards. This is it, if you're ready for it. Your final path to escape, an end of those three horrible years.


// TODO: if player hasn't gotten Orcthorn or hasn't killed the spider, let's dissuade him here


Leaning on the wall next to the third exit is a goblin guard. He's sleeping. He holds a sword in one hand, and there's a shield laid on his lap.
