ROOM: $slave_quarters_passage


DESCRIPTION:
You can see Briana clutching her fists. "Are we homesick already?" she says. But she doesn't wait for reply, and presses on.


It doesn't take long before you start hearing voices. Orcs and goblins shouting commands, mostly. Then human screams.


The tunnel gets wider and better lit by torches. The walls are smoother. You stop down next to a small, reinforced door. Up ahead, something is happening. A human slave is running towards you. His hand is visibly broken just above the elbow and blood is streaming down his limping left leg. His lips are moving but there is no sound anymore, only pain. Eyes in tears, he doesn't see you or anything else.


Before you can so much as call to him, something long and sharp shoots from behind the slave, and into his back. A bloodied spearhead appears in the center of the man's chest, as if growing from there. The tearful eyes go down, looking at the fatal wound. Two more steps and the slave falls face down, the shaft of the spear protruding upwards from his back.


An orc and a goblin appear from the tunnel, walking towards the dead man. The orc is laughing, patting his companion on the back. "Vicious throw, small one!" he roars.


You step back and motion Briana to lean on the wall, hoping that the door's embossed frame will provide enough cover before the two slavers turn again. 


But at that time, something or someone smashes on that very door from the inside. Then come angry growls and something akin to barking and howling.


The door stays shut but the two slavers are now looking directly at you. The goblin yanks his spear from the corpse, and the orc unsheathes his sword. They start towards you.




// TODO: make the goblin a spearman (both sketch and in simulation) -- and make them both goblins - a spearman and a swordsman
