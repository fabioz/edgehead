ROOM: $slave_quarters_passage




DESCRIPTION:
It doesn't take long before you start hearing voices. Orcs shouting commands, mostly. 


// TODO: patrol killing slaves


The tunnel gets wider and better lit by torches. The walls are smoother. You stop down next to a small, reinforced door. Up ahead, two orcs turn a corner and start towards you.


You step back and motion Briana to lean on the wall, hoping that the little door's embossed frame will provide enough cover before the two orcs turn again. 


But at that time, something or someone smashes on the door from the inside. Then come angry growls and something akin to barking.


The door stays shut but the patrol is now looking directly at you, closing in with their swords in hands.
