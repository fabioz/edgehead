COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:




TODO - this must be it. you search to room and find the sword hidden well (under a loose tile? under a heap of corpses?). then "why would they keep the sword at all? why wouldn't they destroy it?" - "fear. it's the ultimate authority. I don't think it was the orcs who decided to keep the sword intact."


Briana: "I can't believe we did it. A farm boy and a freak."


"A freak?"


"A simple thing like this. You don't understand how much the orcs learned to fear the sword. A single knight could hold two dozens of orcs in check just by wielding that sword."


"Well, we still need to get out of here."


SUCCESS_EFFECT:
