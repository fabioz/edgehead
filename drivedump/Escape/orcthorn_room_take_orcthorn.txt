COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
You and Briana nod at each other and start sweeping the room. The mad guardian has left many bizarre things scattered around the space. A box of severed orc hands. Crude drawings of tentacles covering one of the walls, with several gouged out eyes below it. A circle made from half-eaten rats, with a single pebble in the middle.


"None of this makes any sense," Briana says, turning some useless apparatus made of sticks in hand. "He must _really_ have gone mad. From fear, or magic, or both."


Soon, the last place in the room that hasn't been searched by either you or Briana is the large pile of rotting corpses. Mostly orcs, but there are also some human slaves, and many rats and bats. The reek of rotten flesh raises above it in visible, pale fumes. Briana hides her nose in an elbow and starts dragging out the upper, less rotten corpses. You join her.


"The sword will be at the bottom, I bet."


_"Of course. He tried to bury it."_


In what seems like hours of work, you get to the bottom. Among a slush of decayed meat, you feel something hard and cold. Pulling it uncovers a sword.


You fling the weapon and the green-red rot falls to the ground easily, as if it had no traction on the steel. You hold in your hand the brightest, sharpest sword you have ever seen.

"Orcthorn," Briana nods and surveys the blade and the hilt. Gradually, she starts shaking her head. "Why would they keep the sword at all? Why wouldn't they destroy it? They were terrified of it."


_"Fear. It is the ultimate authority. I do not think it was the orcs who decided to keep the sword."_


"Well, now they can start fearing again." Briana crouches next to the corpse of the mad guardian. "And all this because of a common soldier and a farm boy," she says to the lifeless face.


_"I am not a farm boy. And we still need to get out of here first."_
