COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:




TODO - throwing spear at the orc that holds the molten steel gate


Why would you do that? You just wasted a perfectly good spear on a stupid ogre that posed no threat to us.


Watch.


TODO (molten steel ruins everything)


The less simple you see the world, the easier it is for you to change it. 


You got lucky. 


That was some throw! That thing downstairs.. I don't know what it is but I would not want to meet it in battle. - it is probably meant to scale castle walls. - so, fort ironcast. One well placed spear may have prevented the fall of Ironcast. - delayed. - what? - we delayed the fall of the fort, at best.
