COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
You and Briana nod at each other and start searching the room. The Mad Guardian has left many bizarre things scattered around: A box of severed orc hands, crude drawings of tentacles covering one of the walls, several gouged out eyes, a circle made from half-eaten rats with a single pebble in the middle.


"None of this makes any sense," Briana says, turning some useless apparatus made of sticks in her hand. "He must _really_ have gone mad. From fear or magic, or both."


Soon, the last place in the room that hasn't been searched by either you or Briana is the large pile of rotting corpses. Mostly orcs, but there are also some human slaves, and many rats and bats. The stench of rotten flesh is so strong you see pale fumes coming from the pile. Briana shields her nose with an elbow and starts dragging the less rotten corpses from the top. You join her.


"The sword will be at the bottom, I bet."


_"Of course. He tried to bury it."_


After what feels like hours, you get to the bottom. Among a slush of decayed meat, you feel something hard and cold. You pull it from the pile and hold it in the air: the brightest, sharpest sword you have ever seen.

"Orcthorn," Briana nods and surveys its blade and hilt. Gradually, she starts shaking her head. "Why would they keep the sword at all? Why wouldn't they destroy it? They were terrified of it."


_"Fear. It is the ultimate authority. I do not think it was the orcs who decided to keep the sword."_


"Well, now they can start fearing again." Briana crouches next to the corpse of The Mad Guardian." And all this because of a common soldier and a farm boy," she says to the lifeless face.


_"I am not a farm boy. And we still need to get out of here first."_
