DESCRIPTION:
You are Aren, a slave. You have spent three painful years inside this mountain, between the foul-smelling cave walls, and under the whip of the orcs and the goblins that live here. 


You watch Briana straighten over Agruth's corpse. She smooths her hair, using a pool of Agruth's blood as a mirror. "What?" she says when she notices you're looking.


_"We either go now, or die."_


Briana spits down at the body. "He wasn't even the worst of them, you know."


_"I know."_


"They _all_ deserve this, or worse. All of them. And I like the fact we'll kill them by their own swords." She kicks the dead slaver in the hip. 


_"That one is already dead."_


"I was making sure. You understand that we should name the sword, right? It's the only thing we have going for us right now. And I refuse to carry it around referring to it as _Agruth's_." She makes a pained grimace when she says the orc's name.

Briana shrugs. "Whatever, just don't ever call it _Agruth's._ I already have more respect to this piece of iron than to that worthless animal. Now, you're right, let's just get out of here as quickly as possible."
