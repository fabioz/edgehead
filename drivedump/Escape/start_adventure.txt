DESCRIPTION:
The path from slavery to power begins with a single crack of a whip. Briana wheels around, her face red with pain and anger. She is new here, but she knows what will follow. 




Once Agruth starts whipping, the victim ends up dead. Agruth loves killing slaves. 




Another crack and there is new blood on Briana's face. Agruth grins.




Nobody else is in sight. It's just you, Agruth and Briana. That's Agruth's main mistake.
