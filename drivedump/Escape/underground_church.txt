ROOM: $underground_church




DESCRIPTION:
You enter something that at first looks like a large, twisting cave, but then opens into a high room with many columns. This must be what the orcs call the Underground Church. Your bare footsteps reverberate around the space, so you slow down to quiet them. There are no windows, of course, you are deep underground, but there is dim light coming from the far end of the place, where you expect the altar to be but can't quite see it. No torches here. Quiet. 


After a bit of searching, you also notice a twisty passage going from the right hand side of the Church and sloping upwards. That must be the way out.


SHORT_DESCRIPTION: 
The Underground Church stands silent, as if holding breath.




EXITS:
$guardpost_above_church (Enter the passage): You enter the passage and go a long, slightly rising way. 


$cave_with_agruth (Go back to the cave with Agruth's corpse): You sneak out of the church, back towards where you left Agruth's body.


$underground_church_altar (Go towards the altar): You sneak your way among the columns, trying to stay in the shadows.

This place was not built by the orcs or their slaves. Walls are straight and smooth. The columns are decorated with delicate embossments of skulls and tentacles.


Briana: "So this is it? This is where the Dead Prince resides?"


"This is one of many of these temples inside the mountain. So I think not."


"So where is he? Everyone knows he's from Mt. Bloodrock."


"The Dead Prince is _somewhere_ here, that's correct. But where exactly? The orcs say the whole mountain is his vessel. Whatever that means."


The glow coming from the altar dims for a moment, then lights up again.
