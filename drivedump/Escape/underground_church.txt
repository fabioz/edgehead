ROOM: $underground_church




DESCRIPTION:
You enter something that at first looks like a large, twisting cave, but then opens into a high room with many columns. This must be what the orcs call the Underground Church. Your bare footsteps reverberate around the space, so you slow down to quiet them. There are no windows, of course, you are deep underground, but there is dim light coming from the far end of the place, where you expect the altar to be but can't quite see it. No torches here. Quiet.

SHORT_DESCRIPTION: 
The temple stands silent, as if holding breath.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
This place was not built by the orcs or their slaves. Walls are straight and smooth. The ceiling is high enough to make you feel small, negligible, unimportant. The columns are decorated with delicate embossments of skulls and tentacles.


"What are these things?" Briana whispers, looking at the ornaments.


_"This place worships the Dead Prince."_


Saying the name brings coldness and sweat. You hear the name every night in the Dead Prince's tongue — but it has been a long time since you said it yourself.


"Worships?" Briana looks up at the high ceiling, then around the temple. "I though the Dead Prince was a warlord. A shaman. Something like that."


_"He is god."_


// Don't allow the following paragraph if we've been through "Wait" in altar - by then Briana is not sceptical

The glow coming from the altar dims for a moment, then lights up again.


_"He is worse than god. He is fear itself."_


Briana looks at you, narrowing her eyes.


_"I think you have felt it."_
