ROOM: $orcthorn_room




DESCRIPTION:
The room is dark and wet. As you enter, the noises end. Smell of rotting flesh fills your nostrils and almost makes you vomit.


When your eyes become accustomed to the dark, you see a figure standing in front of you, and next to a heap of dead bodies. You realize it's a male orc, but an especially large one, with huge muscles and many scars. His face is in constant motion, overwhelmed by tics and waves of hateful expressions. 




SHORT_DESCRIPTION: 
The room is quiet. The mad guardian's huge body lies on the floor beneath the statue.




FIGHT_SITUATION:
generateMadGuardianFight




EXITS:
$orcthorn_door (Exit the room): You go through the door. Once back in the corridor of the slave quarters, you close it behind you.
