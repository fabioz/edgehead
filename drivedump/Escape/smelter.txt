ROOM: $smelter


DESCRIPTION: 
A blast of smoke and heat greets you as you walk out of the passage and into the room. The roaring fire draws your attention to the far wall, where scores of orcs shovel coal into a giant furnace and tilt huge kettles of molten steel into white-hot rivers. This is the smelter.


// TODO: move most of this into a separate action. This should only say navigational stuff. The "Look around" action should be prerequisite to throw_spear.


The artificial rivers lead the liquid across the room, into a large pool. From that pool, a single ogre is distributing the forge-ready steel into troughs that lead to the war forges below. 


Unlike the orcs, who are on the other side of the large room, the ogre is no more than a spear's throw away from you. But he doesn't notice. In fact, you realize he's blind, probably from all the molten steel around him.

SHORT_DESCRIPTION: 
The reds and whites of the molten steel reflect in the heaps of coal.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
TODO - throwing spear at the orc that holds the molten steel gate


Why would you do that? You just wasted a perfectly good spear on a stupid ogre that posed no threat to us.


Watch.


TODO (molten steel ruins everything)


The less simple you see the world, the easier it is for you to change it. 


You got lucky. 


That was some throw! That thing downstairs.. I don't know what it is but I would not want to meet it in battle. - it is probably meant to scale castle walls. - so, fort ironcast. One well placed spear may have prevented the fall of Ironcast. - delayed. - what? - we delayed the fall of the fort, at best.
