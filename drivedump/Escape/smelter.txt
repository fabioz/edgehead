ROOM: $smelter


DESCRIPTION: 
A blast of smoke and heat greets you as you walk out of the passage and into the room. The roaring fire draws your attention to the far wall, where scores of orcs shovel coal into a giant furnace and tilt huge kettles of molten steel into white-hot rivers. This is the smelter.

SHORT_DESCRIPTION: 
The reds and whites of the molten steel reflect in the heaps of coal.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The artificial rivers lead the molten iron across the room, into a large pool. From that pool, a single ogre is distributing the forge-ready liquid into troughs that descend to the war forges below. 


The ogre is no more than a spear's throw away from you. But he doesn't notice. In fact, you realize he's blind, probably from all the molten steel around him. Yet he's performing his job without fault, listening to commands from orcs in the war forges beyond the wall, and operating the  floodgates accordingly.
