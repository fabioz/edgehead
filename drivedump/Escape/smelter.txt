ROOM: $smelter


DESCRIPTION: 
A blast of smoke and heat greets you as you enter this room. The roaring fire and the clanging of metal draws your attention to the far wall, where scores of orcs shovel coal into a giant furnace. This is the smelter.


Orc teams tilt huge kettles of molten steel into white-hot rivers that lead the liquid across the room, into a large pool. From that pool, a single ogre is distributing the forge-ready steel into troughs that lead to the war forges below. 


He's no more than a spear's throw away from you, but doesn't notice. In fact, you realize he's blind, probably from all the molten steel around him. The orcs are much farther away and too busy to look around.

SHORT_DESCRIPTION: 
The reds and whites of the molten steel reflect in the heaps of coal.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
throwing spear at the orc that holds the molten steel gate


Why would you do that? You just wasted a perfectly good spear on a stupid ogre that posed no threat to us.


Watch.


(molten steel ruins everything)


The less simple you see the world, the easier it is for you to change it. 


You got lucky. 


That was some throw! That thing downstairs.. I don't know what it is but I would not want to meet it in battle. - it is probably meant to scale castle walls. - so, fort ironcast. One well placed spear may have prevented the fall of Ironcast. - delayed. - what? - we delayed the fall of the fort, at best.
