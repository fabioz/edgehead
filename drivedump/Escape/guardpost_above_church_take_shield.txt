ACTION: $guardpost_above_church_take_shield
COMMAND: Cautiously take the shield


HINT: The goblin is asleep but not soundly — the floor here must be cold and uncomfortable. Taking the shield from its position on the goblin's lap will quite likely wake him up.


PREREQUISITES:

FOR_LOCATION: $guardpost_above_church


COMPLETE_SUCCESS_PROBABILITY: 40%


COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION: 
You silently approach the goblin's legs, wait a few moments, then lean over him and deftly lift the shield. The goblin sniffs, moves, but stays asleep.


You take a few slow steps back, then fix the shield on your offhand.


FAILURE_BEGINNING_DESCRIPTION:
You silently approach the goblin's legs, and wait a few moments. You're trying to stay as far away from his nose as possible. The goblin sniffs, moves, but stays asleep. You shift your weight on the right leg, leaning over the goblin and using the other leg as a counterweigh. Briana watches you with amusement.


You touch the shield to lift it, but freeze. The goblin sniffs again, and shifts. If you move, he'll wake up.


RESCUE_COMMAND: Stay perfectly still
RESCUE_HINT: If you stop moving, the guard will go back to sleep. But in this position, staying perfectly still even for a single minute will be quite a feat.
RESCUE_EFFECT: 
w.updateActorById(a.id, (b) => b..stamina -= 1);
RESCUE_DESCRIPTION:
You stay frozen in place. After a while, the strain of holding the awkward position start to show. Your left leg is shaking, and a drop of sweat is forming on your nose, threatening to fall on the goblin's leg.


Fortunately, at about that moment the goblin shifts again and his expression gets visibly more relaxed. His breath is deep and regular again.


You deftly lift the shield, take a few slow steps back, then fix the shield on your offhand.




CONTINUATION_OF_FAILURE_COMMAND: Snatch the shield
CONTINUATION_OF_FAILURE_HINT: You can quickly snatch the shield, jump back and prepare for a fight.
CONTINUATION_OF_FAILURE_EFFECT: 
setUpStealShield(a, w, s, false);
CONTINUATION_OF_FAILURE_DESCRIPTION: 
You snatch the shield and jump back next to Briana. The goblin is suprisingly fast in getting his bearing. He jumps up and gets into combat stance.


// TODO: if player has spear from the altar: He looks at your spear. "Thief!" he hisses.


You hold the shield on your offhand and get ready to fight.


SUCCESS_EFFECT: 
setUpStealShield(a, w, s, true);
