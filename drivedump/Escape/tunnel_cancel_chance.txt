ROOM: $tunnel_cancel_chance


DESCRIPTION:
After a few strides, you realize Briana still stands in the circular room behind.


_"Are you not coming?"_


Briana hesitates. "It feels like we could have done more." She motions at the goblin, then extends her gesture to the rest of the mountain. "Wreak more havoc. Take more. I mean, we might be the first people to be in Mount Bloodrock, and live." 


// _"Let us keep that second part true, then."_


EXITS:
$tunnel (Continue): You shake your head and continue through the passage. Soon, you find yourself climbing a steep, poorly lit stairway. Briana catches up with you.
$guardpost_above_church (Return): You nod, and step back into the circular room.
