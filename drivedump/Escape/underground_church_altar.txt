COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
TODO - build up with sounds


A lich orc enters from a steel door on the right of the altar and the whole temple sounds a tone that is powerful and sickening at the same time. After the lich, a huge creature enters through the door, crouching below the door's frame. It's unclear what it is, but perhaps some large breed of ogre, and judging by the braided hair, a female. Her sword is as long as you are tall, but she doesn't wield it. She leads someone on a chain. An orc. Despite being a strong one, probably captain or even chieftain, he is dwarfed by the creature before him, and he visibly shakes in horror.


TODO: the lich will take him on the altar. Aren says 'maggots', somehow he knows. From underneath the altar, a large horde of maggots appears. The orc tries to escape, horrified, but the ogre pin him. The maggots crawl all over the orc, and as he screams, the church reacts with tones. The lich raises his hands as if in offering. Somehow, Aren find the whole experience invigorating (+2 stamina). Once the orc is dead, rychlý process. Ogre drag the body. Leave. Briana : "how did you know it will be maggots?". Aren : "I'll explain when we get out of here." Briana : "And if it was meant to be an offering, why did they not leave the body?" Aren : "that I don't know"
