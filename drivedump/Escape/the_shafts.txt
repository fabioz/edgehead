ROOM: $the_shafts


DESCRIPTION:
This must be the place that the orcs call the Shafts. It's a tall, seemingly endless room, with many walkways across.


// Must be intriguing and revealing. 
// also, sound / smell


// add 'followers noises' according to flag


You realize there is really only one way out, over one of the walkways. You'll have to run, there is no hiding anymore.


EXITS:
$tunnel (Run): You run over the passage. Orcs start to scream and yell commands. As you near the entrance, the air gets better.
