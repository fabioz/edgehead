DESCRIPTION:
You are Aren, a slave. You have spent three painful years inside this mountain, between the foul-smelling cave walls, and under the whip of the orcs and the goblins that live here. 


Briana stands towering over Agruth's corpse. She smooths her hair back and looks down into the expanding pool of Agruth's blood, using it as a mirror. 


"What?" she says when she notices you're looking.


_"We either go now, or die."_


Briana spits down at the body. "He wasn't even the worst of them, you know."


_"I know."_


"They _all_ deserve to die, or worse. And it’s so satisfying to kill them with their own swords. " She kicks the dead slaver in the hip. 


_"That one is already dead."_


"Just making sure," she says.

She turns her attention to the sword. "We should name it. The gods love named weapons. And I refuse to have this thing around thinking of it as  _Agruth's sword_." She makes a pained grimace when she says the orc's name.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
_"That is foolish. It is just a sword, after all."_


Briana shrugs. "Whatever, just don't ever call it _Agruth's sword._ I already have more respect to this piece of iron than to that worthless animal. Now, you're right, let's just get out of here as quickly as possible."
