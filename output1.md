Briana picks herself up and staggers back before finding balance. The orc rolls and puts his feet under him. He lunges at Briana.

Briana dodges the orc. He hits the rock floor.

Briana throws herself upon the orc. He tries to dodge it. But Briana is too quick for him, and breaks his neck. He stops moving. 

Briana kneels next to Aren and helps him to his feet. "I'll live," he says. Briana gives the scimitar to Briana. From the blackness of the caverns, another orc appears. He raises his sword and he shakes a shield.
